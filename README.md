# StatsHub — An analysis hub for Fantasy Premier League game

## How-to section: 
You might be wondering: how to get the manager id? The answer is simple. Just go to official [Fantasy Premier League Website](https://fantasy.premierleague.com), sign in with your account, go to ‘Pick Team’ then ‘View Gameweek history’. You can find your id in the URL, right before the ‘/history’.
